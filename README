# This repository contains SageMath code produced by Raul C. de Assis and Thiago do Rego Sousa for SBSeg 2025 (Brazilian Symposium on CyberSecurity 2025).
# The authors have developed this code for the short article 'Tailoring a Genetic Algorithm for searching Shortest Lattice Vector in NTRU Lattices'.
#
# The code is authored by Raul C. de Assis and Thiago do Rego Sousa, except the file 'NTRU_lattices.sage', used to generate a random NTRU lattice with specified paramaters, which is (mostly) copied from the site: https://latticehacks.cr.yp.to/ntru.html
# Note: LatticeHacks is joint work by Daniel J. Bernstein, Nadia Heninger, and Tanja Lange.
#
# The code consists of an implementation of a genetic algorithm to find the shortest non-zero vector in an NTRU lattice.
# The algorithm weas desgined by the authors is made public and is still under work and improvements.
# The code is public and can be used by anyone without permission.
